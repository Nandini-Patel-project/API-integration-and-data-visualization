**Weather Forecast API Integration and Data Visualization**

Description:

This is a simple weather forecast application that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data, and visualizes it using Python. It showcases how to integrate third-party APIs, process JSON responses, and create data visualizations using libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

Features:

Fetches daily weather data for a specific location (e.g., Tokyo) using OpenWeatherMap's One Call API.
Visualizes the weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, using line and bar charts.
Allows for easy customization of the location and other parameters in the code.
